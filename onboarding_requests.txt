1. On the geographic locations page, can the user choose multiple specific territories or exclude multiple cities?


Notes:
On the figma, the competitors and influencers page has the main content in a lower position than the other pages on the last row. Was that intentional?
Other pages also have the title in different positions.

10. I originally put a 3 competitor limit since the subtext says to choose 3, but I can change it to however many you want. I'll put it to 10 for now.
12. Fixed similar to #10. I'll set the limit to 10 for now.
